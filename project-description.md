# Text Mining Mini-Project
Tannon, Anastassia, Fabian

For our text mining mini-project we are going to attempt the “Quora Insincere Questions Classification” task on kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification). The task’s aim is to develop a model that can identify insincere questions on the question-and-answer website quora.com.

The kaggle task provides us with training data that consists of 1.3M questions labelled as sincere or insincere.

Our aim is to train two to three models (e.g. one machine learning approach, one deep learning and one word embedding approach), evaluate the models and compare them with each other.
